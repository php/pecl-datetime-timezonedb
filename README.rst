TimezoneDB
==========

This extension is a drop-in replacement for the builtin timezone database that
comes with PHP. You should only install this extension in case you need to get
a later version of the timezone database than the one that ships with PHP.

The data that this extension uses comes from the "Olson" database, which is
located at http://www.iana.org/time-zones.
